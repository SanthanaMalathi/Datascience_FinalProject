💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview
    Credit card fraud is a major challenge for financial institutions due to the highly imbalanced
    nature of transaction data.This project focuses on building an end-to-end machine learning
    pipeline to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using multiple classification
    algorithms and advanced evaluation techniques.

    The project includes:
        1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
        2.Data preprocessing and feature scaling
        3.ANOVA-based feature selection
        4.Handling class imbalance using SMOTE
        5.Model training and comparison
        6.Hyperparameter tuning
        7.Model evaluation using fraud-appropriate metrics
        8.Final model selection and deployment readiness using Pickle and Flask

🎯 Objective
    To accurately identify fraudulent transactions while maintaining a balance between:
        1. High Recall (catching frauds)
        2. High Precision (reducing false alarms)

🔄 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Exploration & Analysis
    Checked dataset structure, data types, and missing values
    Analyzed class imbalance
    Visualized:
        Class distribution
        Transaction amount distribution
        Fraud vs non-fraud transactions
        Correlation heatmap
2️⃣ Data Preprocessing
    Removed duplicate records
    Scaled Amount and Time using StandardScaler
    Dropped original unscaled columns
    Split data into training and testing sets using stratified sampling
3️⃣ Feature Selection using ANOVA (f_classif)
    ANOVA evaluates how strongly each feature is related to the target
    Outputs:
    F-score → Feature importance
    P-value → Statistical significance
    Top features are selected using SelectKBest
4️⃣Handling Class Imbalance
    Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) on training data
    Improved model learning for minority (fraud) class
5️⃣ Model Training
Trained and evaluated the following models:
    Logistic Regression
    Random Forest Classifier
    XGBoost Classifier
    Gradient Boosting classifier
6️⃣ Model Evaluation Metrics
Due to class imbalance, accuracy was avoided.
Instead, the following metrics were used:
    Precision
    Recall
    ROC-AUC
    PR-AUC
    Confusion Matrix
    Precision-Recall Curve
    ROC Curve
7️⃣ Hyperparameter Tuning
    Applied RandomizedSearchCV
    Optimized models using F1-Score
    Tuned parameters for:
        Random Forest
        XGBoost
8️⃣ Final Model Selection
The Tuned Random Forest Classifier was selected as the final model because:
    Higher precision (fewer false positives)
    Strong recall
    Better balance for real-world fraud detection systems

💾 Model Serialization (Pickle)
To enable deployment:
    The trained model  were serialized using pickle
    Ensures consistent preprocessing and prediction during inference
        model_filename = "credit_card_fraud_random_forest.pkl"
        joblib.dump(best_model, model_filename)
🌐 Deployment (Flask)
    A Flask web application loads the pickled model
    Accepts transaction inputs
    Outputs:
        Fraud / Non-Fraud prediction
        Probability score
